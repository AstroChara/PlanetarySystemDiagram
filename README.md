# PlanetarySystemDiagram
Generate planetary system architecture diagrams.

The program draws:
- "Primary": Central bodies of the system. There can be multiple.
- "Secondary": Orbiting bodies.
- "Belt": Belts, debris discs, and rings.
- "Boundary": Straight lines for marking distances of interest.

Features three modes:
- "d": distance
- "P": orbital period
- "S": irradiance
Each with units to choose from.

Note: Size of "Secondary" (usually planet) correlates to the Mass of the object; Radius is unused!
